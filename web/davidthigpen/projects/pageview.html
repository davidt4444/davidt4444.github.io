                    Another project I have that is of interest is a page viewer application that I developed for viewing magazines. I built it for systems without a database, because I've had problems with a lot of administrators that don't have a database setup for their users. It uses text files and regular expressions to work. In addition to that, I have an application that does a similar thing with a database.
