<h3>Interests</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Programming Languages</li>
    <ul>
        <li>For my master's project in computer science, I developed a programming language called FASPL - the fast adaptive spatial programming language - to aid researchers in generating XDDL files, which are files used to perform joins in the Granite database system.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Parallel Compression</li>
    <ul>
        <li>For work published in the Journal of the Mississippi Academy of Sciences, I worked on a program called czip for the Cell Broadband Engine. As part of my work, I took a program that had originally been written by Andy Anderson for the Cell Broadband Engine using Cell s.d.k. 1.0 and Mark Adler and Jean-loup Gailly's zlib to compress the files. I converted this code to cell s.d.k. 2.1, eliminated the existing 2 gig file size barrier and fixed the header errors (making the file fully gzip compliant).</li>
        <li>I am also working on a parallel version of bgzip2 for the Cell Broadband Engine that will be based on the current parallel version of bgzip2.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Magazines and Consumer Economics</li>
    <ul>
        <li>For my thesis, I performed research covering the economic theory behind magazine business decisions, calculating the price and income elasticities of demand for magazines and the elasticity of supply of magazine advertising. I also looked into the problems with calculating these things for free publications.</li>
        <li>I have helped enter data on new magazine launches for <em>Samir Husni's Guide to New Magazines</em>, which is an annually published guide on all of
            the new magazine launches for each year.</li>
    </ul>
